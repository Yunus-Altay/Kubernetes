#  Node affinity rule dictates that pods can only be placed on a node with a label whose key is 'size' and whose value is 'large' or 'medium'
# With the other type of node affinity -preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution-, the scheduler still schedules pods even if a matching node is not available
